## Significant Projects

### [**Stock Ticker for OBS**](https://github.com/Gami13/StockTicker) (Go)
- Developed a stock ticker application for OBS Studio, allowing users to display real-time stock prices and market data on their streams.
- Implemented web scraping techniques to fetch stock data from bing, that gets sent to the UI via websockets. The UI is served using embedded HTML files.

### [**Music Player**](https://github.com/Gami13/MusicPlayer) (Android - Kotlin)
- Engineered a feature-rich music player with direct YouTube song download capabilities.
- Implemented modern Android UI/UX principles, including Material Design 3, Material You dynamic theming (adapting to wallpaper and system settings), internationalization, and background playback.


### [**Can I Skip**](https://github.com/Gami13/can-i-skip) (Android - Kotlin)
- Developed an Android app to track school attendance and calculate allowed absences based on a user-set percentage.
- Leveraged an unofficial SDK to integrate with the school's attendance system, showcasing API interaction and native Android development skills.
- Note: Currently non-functional due to external authentication changes of the school's chosen system.

### [**WSV in Go**](https://github.com/Gami13/WSV-golang) (Go)
- Developed a library for parsing and serializing structured data in a human-readable WSV format, which was not available for Go before.


### [**Discord Client**](https://github.com/ErisTeam/Strife) (Tauri, SolidJS, TypeScript, Rust)
- Led a 5-person team in developing a Discord client, overseeing both Rust and TypeScript development.
- Drove TypeScript-side development, focusing on core functionality and layout.
- Implemented innovative features like tabbed channels and enhanced personalization, distinguishing it from existing clients.
- Note: Project was later abandoned due to not achieveing the performance improvements we wanted (more details in the repo).
- Learning from this, I'd now use a framework like React Native to achieve our performance goals, as it compiles directly to native UI instead of relying on a webview.
